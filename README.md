QtUsb
=====

Simple usb device setup loger via libusb - in progress, quite far from perfection. Its meant to provide basic information of connected usb devices. Its base clases are created so that could be used in as c++ cover for libusb in other projects. Created mostly for fun while reading and learning about USB. 
To add: → outputing configuration of devices → simple transfer functions for hid and bulk
